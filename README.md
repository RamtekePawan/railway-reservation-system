# Railway Reservation System
Project Documentation: Railway Reservation System

## 1. Introduction:
The Railway Reservation System is a Java-based project developed by a team of two members. The system focuses on core Java concepts, utilizing file I/O to store and manage user data, ticket status, and train details. It provides a user-friendly interface with two login options, one for administrators and another for regular users. Users can register, log in, book tickets, view train details, and perform various operations. Administrators have additional privileges such as adding and deleting train details.

## 2. Features:
   ### a. User Registration and Login:
      - Users can register by providing necessary details.
      - Secure login system allows users to authenticate their credentials.

  ### b. User Actions:
      - Users can view available train details.
      - Booking tickets by selecting a train and providing necessary details.
      - Ticket status and details are stored using file I/O.

  ### c. Admin Actions:
      - Admins can log in using separate credentials.
      - Admins can add new train details, including train number, name, departure, and arrival information.
      - Train details can be deleted based on the train number.

## 3. Implementation Details:
  ### a. User Management:
      - User details such as user ID and password are stored in a file using DataOutputStream.
      - User details are read from the file using DataInputStream for display purposes.

  ### b. User Login:
      - Users can log in by providing their user ID and password.
      - User credentials are verified by comparing them with stored data in the file.

   ### c. Ticket Reservation:
      - Users can reserve tickets by selecting a train and providing passenger details.
      - Passenger details such as name, ID, seat number, and train number are stored in a separate file.

 ###  d. Train Details:
      - Admins can add train details by entering train information.
      - Train details are stored in a file using DataOutputStream.
      - Train details can be displayed to users by reading from the file using DataInputStream.

  ### e. Exception Handling:
      - Proper exception handling techniques are implemented throughout the code.

## 4. Conclusion:
The Railway Reservation System project demonstrates the team's proficiency in core Java concepts. The use of file I/O for data storage ensures efficient management of user details, ticket status, and train information. The system provides a user-friendly interface with separate login options for admins and users, allowing for seamless registration, ticket booking, and viewing of train details. The project highlights the team's ability to collaborate effectively and implement essential functionalities for a railway reservation system.
